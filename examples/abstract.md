AI agents are able to tackle increasingly complex tasks. To achieve more ambitious goals, AI agents need
to be able to meaningfully decompose problems into manageable sub-components, and safely delegate
their completion across to other AI agents and humans alike. Yet, existing task decomposition and
delegation methods rely on simple heuristics, and are not able to dynamically adapt to environmental
changes and robustly handle unexpected failures. Here we propose an adaptive framework for intelligent
AI delegation - a sequence of decisions involving task allocation, that also incorporates transfer of
authority, responsibility, accountability, clear specifications regarding roles and boundaries, clarity
of intent, and mechanisms for establishing trust between the two (or more) parties. The proposed
framework is applicable to both human and AI delegators and delegatees in complex delegation networks,
aiming to inform the development of protocols in the emerging agentic web.
