# Future Cleanups Tracker

This note tracks small follow-up cleanups that are intentionally out of scope for the
current milestone PR sequence.

## Pending

- `cleanup-policy-cli-strictness-defaults`:
  align `policy validate`, `policy eval`, and `policy diff` strictness defaults and
  preserve explicit compatibility flags. This is the separate cleanup PR noted during N2 planning.
