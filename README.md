# ADEU Studio

ADEU Studio is an interactive workflow for turning legal clauses into **typed ADEU IR variants** (with first-class ambiguity), validating them with an authoritative kernel, and storing accepted artifacts.

This repo is a monorepo:

- `packages/adeu_ir`: Pydantic ADEU IR + JSON Schema export (single source of truth)
- `packages/adeu_kernel`: Deterministic checker/kernel + golden fixture harness
- `apps/api`: FastAPI service (scaffolded after kernel is green)
- `apps/web`: Next.js UI (scaffolded after kernel is green)

## Quickstart

```bash
make bootstrap
make test
make lint
```
